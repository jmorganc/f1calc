Make a restful API to query? Yes!
JSON files to replace lists / data structures?
	Probably. Can change it around and re-run program to see different options?
	Build JSON (drivers and grandsprix) from constants in the code
Move stuff off to modules/classes
Database?
    prepend tables with year e.g. 2013_drivers, 2013_grandsprix
Should I be recording place or points in the JSON files?
